## Integrated with government data
Company policies requires that wholesale clients have a CNPJ (It's the business ID in Brazil) that is registered on clothing sector. 
So when the client sends the CNPJ, the bot checks with government API if the clients satisfy the requirements. 
If everything is all right, a link for the company online catalogue is sended.
